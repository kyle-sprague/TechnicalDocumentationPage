This project is the Technical Documentation Project from FreeCodeCamp. Included in the page are the scripts that run the tests on the project.
Some freecodecamp projects have issues passing tests when the scrpits provided are used. This is one such projects, and in order to get all the tests to pass the project must be tested in browser rather than using scripts. 
This project passes all tests when tested that way.
